//this will have multiple sections, one for each day of the week and filter based off the object value it will be rendered to that dates card
//might need to make another child component to pass the cards into and to render on the DOM.
// maybe have when card is clicked, it should take you to the cards page or open just that card to show the image and click again to close it (like a learn more btn)
