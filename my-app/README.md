# My Phase-2 Project

## What my project is:
    Unsure what to wear today? Want to not waste time picking out an outfit? 
    By being able to upload outfits and add them to a weeklong calendar, this project will allow you to do just that.
    Upload outfits, name, description, and photo. 

## How to start it up:
    Clone the repository and open it in your terminal. 
    Navigate to the my-app folder and run:
   `$ npm install` or `$ npm i`
   
    Once your dependencies are installed, run:
   `$ npm run server` 

    Then in a new termonal, run:
   `$ npm start` 

    You will then be taken to the browser to start using the project.


## How to use it:
    Once you click on the checkbox proving you are human you be taken to the home page.
    The Home page is where you upload your outfit, giving it a name and description and posting a link to your image.

    After the outfit is added you will be able to check it out in your Portfolio.
    In the portfolio you have the option to delete an outfit or add it to your wardrobe using the drop down.
    Select the day you would like to wear your outfit and click on the add button.
    You will be able to see the outfits you designated for the week in the Wardrobe.

## Key details:
    To upload an image it will have to be a link.
